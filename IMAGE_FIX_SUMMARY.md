# NFT Image Rendering Fix Summary

**Issue:** Images not rendering on NFTs page  
**Date:** January 2025

---

## üîß Fixes Applied

### 1. Enhanced Image URL Validation in `nft-card.tsx`
- Added proper null/empty string checking
- Ensured `imageUrl` always has a valid value
- Improved placeholder fallback logic

### 2. Improved IPFS URL Handling
- Added `unoptimized` prop for IPFS URLs (Next.js Image component has issues optimizing IPFS URLs)
- Properly detects IPFS URLs (cloudflare-ipfs.com, ipfs.io)
- Prevents Next.js from trying to optimize external IPFS images

### 3. Better Error Handling
- Enhanced `onLoad` and `onError` handlers
- Proper state management for loading/error states
- Graceful fallback to placeholder on errors

## üß™ Testing Steps

After deployment, test:

1. **Navigate to /nfts page**
2. **Check browser console for errors:**
   - Open DevTools (F12)
   - Go to Console tab
   - Look for image loading errors
   - Look for CSP violations

3. **Check Network tab:**
   - Open DevTools ‚Üí Network tab
   - Filter by "Img"
   - Verify images are loading from IPFS gateways
   - Check for 404 errors

4. **Verify image URLs:**
   - Check a few NFT cards
   - Right-click image ‚Üí "Inspect"
   - Check the `src` attribute
   - Should be either:
     - `https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/...`
     - `https://ipfs.io/ipfs/...`
     - `/nfts/placeholder-nft.webp` (if image missing)

## üêõ Debugging If Images Still Don't Load

### Check 1: Image URLs in Metadata
```javascript
// In browser console on /nfts page:
// Check what image URLs are being passed to cards
document.querySelectorAll('[alt*="Satoshe Slugger"]')[0].closest('div').querySelector('img').src
```

### Check 2: CSP Blocking Images
- Look for CSP violations in console
- If images are blocked by CSP, we may need to adjust `next.config.mjs`

### Check 3: IPFS Gateway Availability
- Try accessing an IPFS URL directly in browser
- If gateway is down, images won't load
- Cloudflare IPFS gateway should be reliable

### Check 4: Image File Format
- Verify images are in supported formats (PNG, JPG, WebP)
- Check if IPFS links point to valid image files

## üìù Files Changed

- `components/nft-card.tsx` - Enhanced image handling and IPFS support
- Build verified: ‚úÖ Build succeeds

## üöÄ Next Steps

1. Test locally with `pnpm dev`
2. If images load locally, commit and push to branch
3. Deploy preview on Vercel
4. Test on preview deployment
5. Fix any remaining issues
6. Merge to main when ready
