# Thirdweb AI - Help Request

## Context

I'm working with a Thirdweb Marketplace V3 contract on the Base blockchain and need help canceling existing NFT listings and creating new listings with correct prices.

## Problem

I have 1,866 NFTs that were accidentally listed at the wrong price (0.00333 ETH - Ground Ball tier price) when they should have been priced based on their rarity tier (ranging from 0.00333 ETH to 1 ETH).

## Files Available

I have two JSON files with all the data needed:

1. **File Path:** `scripts/mispriced_nfts.json`
   - Contains all 1,866 mispriced NFTs with:
   - `token_id` (the NFT)
   - `listing_id` (the listing to cancel)
   - `expected_price_eth` (correct price)
   - `actual_price_eth` (current wrong price)
   
2. **File Path:** `scripts/mispriced_by_tier.json`
   - Same data but grouped by rarity tier
   - Keys: "Grand Slam (Ultra-Legendary)", "Walk-Off Home Run", "Home Run", etc.

## Contract Details

- **Marketplace Contract:** `0x187A56dDfCcc96AA9f4FaAA8C0fE57388820A817`
- **NFT Collection:** `0x53b062474eF48FD1aE6798f9982c58Ec0267c2Fc`
- **Chain:** Base (Chain ID: 8453)
- **Marketplace Version:** V3 with Direct Listings

## What I Need

I need a Node.js script that:

1. **Imports/connects to Thirdweb SDK** for Base chain
2. **Reads the JSON files** to get the mispriced NFT data
3. **For each NFT:**
   - Cancel the existing listing using `listing_id`
   - Create a new listing using `token_id` at the `expected_price_eth`
4. **Uses proper authentication** (needs private key from user)
5. **Handles gas fees and waiting for confirmations** between transactions

## Current Attempt

I tried creating a script using:
- `cancelListing()` from `thirdweb/extensions/marketplace`
- `createListing()` from `thirdweb/extensions/marketplace`

But these functions don't exist in the Thirdweb SDK or I'm using them incorrectly.

## Example Data

Here's an example from `mispriced_by_tier.json`:

```json
{
  "Grand Slam (Ultra-Legendary)": [
    {
      "token_id": 1131,
      "listing_id": "1129",
      "name": "Satoshe Slugger #1132",
      "rarity_tier": "Grand Slam (Ultra-Legendary)",
      "expected_price_eth": 1,
      "actual_price_eth": 0.00333,
      "price_difference_eth": 0.99667,
      "dollar_difference": 2392.008
    }
  ]
}
```

## What I Need Help With

1. **Correct function names** to:
   - Cancel a marketplace listing
   - Create a new marketplace listing

2. **Proper SDK setup** including:
   - How to create a signer/wallet with private key
   - How to connect to marketplace contract
   - Required imports

3. **Complete working script** that:
   - Reads the mispriced NFT data
   - Iterates through each NFT
   - Cancels old listing
   - Creates new listing at correct price
   - Includes proper error handling and gas management

## Priority

Most urgent: Grand Slam tier (33 NFTs, should be 1 ETH each, currently at 0.00333 ETH)

Can you provide:
1. The correct Thirdweb SDK functions for canceling and creating listings
2. A complete working example script
3. Any authentication setup needed
