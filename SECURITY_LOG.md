# Satoshe Sluggers - Security & Development Log

**Created:** October 2024  
**Purpose:** Track security audits, changes, questions, and concerns for a $10M+ NFT collection

---

## 🔒 Security Philosophy

**Zero Tolerance for Security Vulnerabilities**

This is a high-value collection ($10M+). Security standards must be:
- No hardcoded secrets, addresses, or credentials
- No fallback values that could be exploited
- Fail-hard approach: If env vars missing, app crashes (don't silently degrade)
- All sensitive data must come from environment variables
- Regular security audits before deployment

---

## ✅ Security Audits & Fixes

### October 2024 - Image Rendering Fix ✅
**Status:** Fixed and Verified by User

**Issue:** Images not rendering on `/nfts` page

**Fix Applied:**
- Enhanced image URL validation in `components/nft-card.tsx`
- Added proper IPFS URL handling with `unoptimized` prop (Next.js Image component has issues optimizing external IPFS images)
- Improved error handling and placeholder fallback logic
- Fixed boolean type issue in IPFS URL detection

**Result:** Images now display correctly on NFTs page ✨

**Files Changed:**
- `components/nft-card.tsx`

---

### October 2024 - Production Security Hardening

#### Fixed Issues:

1. **Removed Fallback Client ID in Scripts** ✅
   - **File:** `scripts/get-all-listings-database.mjs`
   - **Issue:** Had fallback chain: `process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID || process.env.THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID || process.env.INSIGHT_CLIENT_ID`
   - **Risk:** Could allow using wrong client ID if env vars misconfigured
   - **Fix:** Removed all fallbacks, added explicit validation with error throwing
   - **Status:** FIXED

2. **Removed Hardcoded Contract Addresses** ✅
   - **File:** `scripts/full-inventory.ts`
   - **Issue:** Hardcoded addresses for NFT collection and marketplace
   - **Risk:** Maintenance issues, potential for wrong contract usage
   - **Fix:** Now uses env vars exclusively, validates before use
   - **Status:** FIXED

3. **Added Runtime Validation for Contract Address** ✅
   - **File:** `lib/constants.ts`
   - **Issue:** Used non-null assertion (`!`) but didn't validate
   - **Risk:** Silent failures if env var missing
   - **Fix:** Added explicit validation that throws error if missing
   - **Status:** FIXED

4. **Removed Invalid ThirdwebProvider Prop** ✅
   - **File:** `app/layout.tsx`
   - **Issue:** Attempted to add `supportedChains` prop which doesn't exist in Thirdweb v5
   - **Risk:** Build failure
   - **Fix:** Removed prop; chains are specified per contract (all use `chain: base` explicitly)
   - **Status:** FIXED

5. **Verified Thirdweb Client Validation** ✅
   - **File:** `lib/thirdweb.ts`
   - **Status:** Already has proper validation, no changes needed

6. **Verified Contract Configuration** ✅
   - **File:** `lib/contracts.ts`
   - **Status:** Already has proper validation for both contracts (collection and marketplace)

7. **Fixed TypeScript Build Errors in Scripts** ✅
   - **File:** `scripts/full-inventory.ts`
   - **Issue:** TypeScript couldn't infer types after validation
   - **Fix:** Added type assertions after validation (safe because we validate first)
   - **Status:** FIXED - Build now succeeds

8. **Removed Fallbacks from Disabled Contact Route** ✅
   - **File:** `app/api/contact-disabled/route.ts`
   - **Issue:** Had fallback values for email domain and contact email
   - **Risk:** Low (route disabled), but poor security practice
   - **Fix:** Removed all fallbacks, added fail-hard validation
   - **Status:** FIXED

#### Current Security Status:

✅ **All environment variables validated with fail-hard approach**  
✅ **No hardcoded secrets or credentials**  
✅ **No fallback values that could be exploited**  
✅ **All scripts use env vars exclusively**  
✅ **Runtime validation prevents silent failures**  
✅ **Build succeeds with zero errors**  
✅ **TypeScript strict mode enforced**

## 📋 Questions & Concerns

### Question 1: Environment Variable Naming
**Date:** October 2024  
**Issue:** Codebase uses `NEXT_PUBLIC_CREATOR_ADDRESS` but user's env vars show:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_CONTRACT_OWNER`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_COLLECTION_OWNER`

**Status:** User confirmed env vars work correctly, so likely todos mapped in Vercel  
**Action Needed:** None (user verified working)  
**Risk Level:** None (confirmed working)

---

## 🛠️ Changes Made

### Production Checklist Completion (January 2025)

#### Framework & Runtime
- ✅ Added Node.js version constraint (`>=18 <21`) to `package.json`
- ✅ Verified Turbopack builds without warnings

#### Thirdweb Integration
- ✅ Verified Base chain is specified per contract (not needed at provider level in v5)
- ✅ Verified disconnect button exists (in ConnectButton component)
- ✅ Confirmed Base chain used throughout codebase

#### Environment Management
- ✅ Verified all env vars set correctly (user confirmed)
- ✅ Removed all hardcoded addresses from scripts
- ✅ Added runtime validation (fail-hard approach)

#### Security Headers
- ✅ Added `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp`
- ✅ Added `X-DNS-Prefetch-Control: on`

#### CSP (Content Security Policy)
- ✅ Tightened `connect-src` with explicit domains
  - User's domains: `retinaldelights.io`, `satoshesluggers.com` (with/without www)
  - Thirdweb, WalletConnect, IPFS, Vercel, Termly domains
- ✅ Tightened `script-src` with explicit domains
- ✅ Added explicit `frame-src` for Termly and Thirdweb

#### Code Quality
- ✅ Removed hardcoded addresses from `scripts/full-inventory.ts`
- ✅ Removed fallback values from `scripts/get-all-listings-database.mjs`
- ✅ Added validation to `lib/constants.ts`
- ✅ Verified TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ✅ Verified console.log removal configured for production
- ✅ Verified error boundary wraps entire app

#### UI/UX Improvements
- ✅ Replaced Live/Sold text with ShadCN ToggleGroup component
- ✅ Fixed rarity filter matching (Grand Slam tier)
- ✅ Fixed URL double-encoding issue
- ✅ Fixed TypeScript warnings across components

## 🚨 Known Issues & TODOs

### Critical (Fix Before Production)

None currently - all critical security issues addressed ✅

### Medium Priority

1. **CSP Testing Required**
   - Need to test after deployment that CSP doesn't break:
     - Wallet connection
     - NFT purchases
     - Image loading
     - Termly banner
   - **Status:** Waiting for deployment test

2. **Security Headers Testing**
   - Need to verify headers don't break Thirdweb wallet popups
   - **Status:** Waiting for deployment test

### Low Priority / Data Issues

1. **Duplicate Entries in Pricing Mappings**
   - 358 duplicates found in `token_pricing_mappings.json`
   - **Type:** Data issue, not code issue
   - **Risk:** None (data consistency only)
   - **Action:** Clean up data if needed (not blocking)

---

## 📝 Environment Variables Reference

### Required Variables (All Validated, No Fallbacks)

- `NEXT_PUBLIC_THIRDWEB_CLIENT_ID` - Thirdweb SDK client ID
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_COLLECTION_ADDRESS` - NFT contract address (public, shown for reference only)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_MARKETPLACE_ADDRESS` - Marketplace contract address (public, shown for reference only)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CREATOR_ADDRESS` - Creator/owner address (for sold/live detection)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_ID` - Chain ID (8453 for Base)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CHAIN_NAME` - Chain name ("Base")

**Note:** User may also have:
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_CONTRACT_OWNER`
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_NFT_COLLECTION_OWNER`

These may be aliases or mapped in Vercel - confirmed working by user.
