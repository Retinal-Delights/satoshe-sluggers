# Termly Cookie Consent Banner - Configuration & Troubleshooting

## üîç Current Implementation Status

### ‚úÖ What's Configured:
- **Script Load Strategy**: `beforeInteractive` (loads early, before page becomes interactive)
- **Auto-block**: `data-auto-block="on"` (blocks scripts until consent)
- **Website UUID**: `ba09ca99-2e6c-4e83-adca-6b3e27ffe054`
- **CSP Headers**: Termly domains allowed in Content-Security-Policy
- **Fallback Detection**: Code checks if banner appears and attempts to show it if missing

### üõ°Ô∏è Security & Legal Considerations

**Important**: Termly uses a **banner** (bottom overlay), NOT a popup window. Popup blockers should NOT affect it because:
- Banners are injected directly into the page DOM
- They're not separate browser windows
- They don't trigger popup blocker detection

**However**, the script can still be blocked by:
1. **Network issues** - Script fails to load
2. **Content Security Policy violations** - CSP blocks the script (we've allowed it)
3. **Privacy browsers** (like DuckDuckGo) - May block third-party scripts entirely
4. **Ad blockers** - Some ad blockers block cookie consent scripts

## üîß What I've Added

### 1. **Earlier Script Loading**
- Changed from `afterInteractive` to `beforeInteractive`
- Loads Termly script earlier in the page lifecycle

### 2. **Verification & Fallback**
- Checks if Termly script loaded successfully
- Verifies banner appears in DOM after 1 second
- Attempts to manually display banner if it didn't auto-show
- Logs warnings if script fails to load

### 3. **Error Handling**
- `onError` handler logs if script fails to load
- Console warnings for debugging
- Graceful degradation (site still works if Termly fails)

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Known Limitations

### DuckDuckGo Browser
DuckDuckGo browser has **very aggressive privacy settings**:
- Blocks third-party trackers/scripts by default
- May prevent Termly script from loading entirely
- This is a browser-level privacy feature, not something we can bypass

**What this means legally:**
- If a user's browser blocks the script, it's **their choice** to use privacy-focused browsers
- You've done your part by implementing the consent banner
- You cannot force scripts to load if the browser prevents it
- This is similar to users disabling JavaScript entirely

### Recommendations:

1. **Test in DuckDuckGo** - Verify what happens when script is blocked
2. **Check Termly Dashboard** - Verify your Termly account settings for banner display
3. **Legal Consultation** - Consider consulting with a privacy lawyer about:
   - Whether blocking by privacy browsers counts as "user consent refusal"
   - Whether you need additional consent mechanisms
   - Terms of service regarding cookie usage

## üß™ How to Verify Banner Works

### Testing Steps:

1. **Clear all cookies/localStorage** for your site
2. **Open DevTools** ‚Üí Console tab
3. **Reload page**
4. **Check for**:
   - Banner appears at bottom of page
   - No console errors about Termly
   - Termly script loaded (Network tab ‚Üí look for `embed.min.js`)
5. **Check DuckDuckGo specifically**:
   - Open site in DuckDuckGo browser
   - Check console for Termly loading
   - If blocked, it's expected behavior

## üîç Debugging

### If Banner Doesn't Appear:

1. **Check Browser Console**:
   ```javascript
   // In console, check:
   window.Termly // Should exist if script loaded
   document.querySelector('[id*="termly"]') // Should find banner element
   ```

2. **Check Network Tab**:
   - Look for `embed.min.js` request
   - Check if it loaded (200 status) or was blocked

3. **Check CSP Violations**:
   - Console ‚Üí Filter ‚Üí CSP violations
   - Should not see Termly-related CSP errors

4. **Check Cookies**:
   - Application tab ‚Üí Cookies
   - Look for `termly-consent` or similar cookies

## üìù Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Code is updated** - Better verification and fallback
2. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Test in DuckDuckGo** - See what actually happens
3. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Check Termly Dashboard** - Verify banner settings
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è **Legal Review** - Consider privacy lawyer consultation if concerned about liability
