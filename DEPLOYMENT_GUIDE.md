## üöÄ How to Deploy a Branch to Vercel (Without Merging)

### Option 1: Deploy via Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

1. **Push your branch to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Your commit message"
   git push origin dev/production-improvements
   ```

2. **Deploy via Vercel Dashboard:**
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Select your project (`satoshe-sluggers`)
   - Click "Deployments" tab
   - Click "Create Deployment" button
   - Select branch: `dev/production-improvements`
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Or: Vercel automatically creates preview deployments**
   - Vercel automatically creates preview deployments for every push to non-main branches
   - After pushing, check Vercel dashboard for the preview URL
   - Preview URL format: `satoshe-sluggers-git-dev-production-improvements-[username].vercel.app`

### Option 2: Deploy via Vercel CLI

```bash
# Install Vercel CLI (if not installed)
npm i -g vercel

# Link to your project (if not already linked)
vercel link

# Deploy current branch
vercel --prod=false  # Creates preview deployment

# Or deploy to specific branch
vercel --branch=dev/production-improvements
```
